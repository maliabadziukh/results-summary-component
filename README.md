## My process

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This was great practice for using flexbox as the main layout tool. I also don't often work with vanilla CSS so it was interesting to manually write everything out instead of, for example, using tailwind utility classes.
It was nice to work with breakpoints and really pay attention to which properties should change at breakpoints and which ones can stay the same.

I normally work with angular so it was a learning point for me to figure out how to dynamically add HTML elements to the DOM via JS based on the data from the JSON file in the project directory.

### Continued development

It would be interesting to recreate the same component with Angular and Tailwind to see what the differences in the development process are and what are the benefits and downsides of each method.
